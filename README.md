BlocJams Angular was my second project with Bloc. It is a Spotify like music player.  It is different from the original BlocJams because I used the AngularJS framework to build it.  In its current form it allows the user to listen to predownloaded music as well as to adjust the volume, stop and start songs, and move thought out a song.
